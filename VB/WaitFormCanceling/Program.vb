' Developer Express Code Central Example:
' How to cancel time-consuming operation from the WaitForm
' 
' This example illustrates how to cancel a time-consuming operation on a WaitForm.
' To accomplish this task, place a BackgroundWorker and SplashScreenManager onto a
' Form, and add the Cancel button in the WaitForm's designer. The main idea is to
' perform data loading in a background thread, pass the ILocked object both to the
' WaitForm and to this thread, and check its condition while data is loading.
'
